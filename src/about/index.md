The idea for this site started in 2013, when a friend was trying to go back and retag her old Tumblr posts.
Without a way to easily see all her untagged posts, it was impossible for her to be sure that she was done.
I wrote her <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2013/08/untagged-tumblr-posts/">a Python script</a> to get the job done, and that was that.

In 2014, I was getting a lot of hits to that post, but a Python script isnâ€™t very user friendly.
I wrote this site to be an easier way to get a list of your untagged posts, because clearly it was something people wanted.

All the source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexwlchan/untagged-tumblr-posts), and released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

This site is written by me, [alexwlchan](https://alexwlchan.net), and you can learn more about me on [my personal site](https://alexwlchan.net/about/).
